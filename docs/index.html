            <h1>Technical Approach</h1>
            <hr />

            <p><strong>Running WAMR on Zephyr OS.</strong></p>

            <p>
                First, we got familiar with compiling applications for embedded systems. Getting a Blinky project
                running on
                Zephyr took the most time. We were inexperienced
                with interacting so closely with build tools and most installed software needed to be adjusted to
                work. All this was further complicated by the fact
                that the latest version of CMake was buggy (<a
                    href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/30232">zephyr#30232</a>). However, Zephyr
                developers in their Slack channel helped us out.
            </p>

            <p>WAMR already supports Zephyr OS and it has a mini-product available too. We had a Nordic nRF52840 DK
                board
                available, and so we decided to run WAMR on it. The mini-product is a sample
                program that sets-up the WAMR runtime, calls its main function and exits. Setting up a running
                baseline made us understand these key concepts about WAMR: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A C/C++ (native) program needs to set-up WAMR runtime. This program is what we flash to the board.
                </li>
                <li>The WAMR runtime needs to know how much stack and heap memory its modules can have. </li>
                <li>WASM program is not sent over USB in mini-product, but its binary form is encoded in a C string
                    available
                    to the native program.</li>
                <li>Our native program can pass arguments and store the result value from any function in the WASM
                    program,
                    including main().</li>
                <li>The WASM program can pass control to any functions defined natively.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />

            <p><strong>Compiling to WASM Modules</strong></p>

            <p>
                Once we had the WASM program provided with WAMR running on Zephyr, we wanted to run our own WASM
                programs. We learned that WASI-SDK comes with a CLang compiler that can produce WASM bytecode from C
                programs. Also, appropriate flags were needed to be set so that the linker does not complain of missing
                main() when it is not needed, and also to export other functions. There exported functions have their
                definition missing from the WASM module. WAMR runtime can link functions from the native program to
                these
                exported functions. This allows the WASM program to call any needed native functions to, for example,
                blink an LED.
            </p>

            <hr />

            <p><strong>Porting WAMR to Mbed</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>We first needed to set-up our system so that it builds Mbed OS. We set up the toolchain and the
                    appropriate dependencies for our application. This included installing CMake, GNU ARM, and Python 3
                    with some additional packages. For our Windows machines, we also had to find a workable generator
                    for
                    CMake, which turned out to be MinGW make. </li>

                <li>We needed to incorporate the compiling process of WAMR with Mbed OS, so that functions from
                    both were available to our native program. WAMR uses CMake as its build system. The official Mbed
                    CLI uses Python, and this was a major problem. However, we were able to find a CMake build of Mbed
                    OS, made by researchers at <a
                        href="https://forums.mbed.com/t/mbed-cli-alternative-mbed-cmake/9357">USC RPL</a>. From then, we
                    learned CMake commands and included WAMR in the
                    middle of the CMake files of Mbed. This allowed WAMR to be a part of the Mbed static OS library
                    available
                    to native programs.</li>

                <li>Next, we needed to implement the platform abstraction layer in WAMR. All of the OS-dependent
                    functions
                    have been separated down to a few functions, and the rest of WAMR is OS independent. We implemented
                    the API required for the WAMR interpreter.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />

            <p><strong>Comparing Different WASM Interpreters</strong></p>

            <p>
                With WAMR interpreter now available on Mbed devices, we wrote a recursive Fibonacci
                function for all the boards we had:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>WAMR</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Zephyr OS on Nordic nRF52840-DK</li>
                    <li>Mbed OS on STM32 Nucleo F411-RE</li>
                </ul>
                <li>WASM3</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Mbed OS on Arduino Nano 33 BLE
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>
                WASM3 supports Arduino Nano 33 and is available to use through Arduino IDE. However, it only consists of
                an interpreter, while our WAMR porting to Mbed can be extended to allow WAMR JIT, WAMR AoT, and WAMR's
                libraries are also available on targets supported by Mbed.

                contains two binaries with WAMR. Both of them were successfully compiled using
                our build system for Mbed and WAMR. Both are built from the same native and WASM program, but
                are target to two different boards: STM32 Nucleo and Arduino Nano 33.
            </p>

            <p>
                We were able to verify implementation by running it on a STM32 Nucleo board. <a

                added in the Github repo. Since the STM32 Nucleo board is Mbed-enabled, we were able to run our binary
                without worrying about the bootloader. The output demonstrated that WAMR is now running on the Mbed
                device
                using Mbed's libraries.

            <p>
                We used the benchmark of measuring the execution time of computing 24th Fibonacci number recursively. This
                computation when performed by any WASM interpreter was much slower when compared to native. This was
                expected. However, it was surprising that WAMR had little overhead to set up, and most of the extra time
                taken was while doing the computation.

            <p>
                WASM3 claimed to be the fastest WASM interpreter. We could not run WASM3 and WAMR on the same board and
                directly compare them, as WASM3 is not supported on SMT32 Nucleo board and we could not flash to Arduino
                Nano 33 without using Arduino IDE. However, we indirectly attempted to compare WASM3 with WAMR, by
                measuring how many times slower was the interpreter in doing its computation as compared to natively
                calculating it. WASM3 indeed slower down less as compared to WAMR. However, WASM3 is only an
                interpreter, while WAMR AoT can be implemented for Mbed which should be faster than WASM3.

            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Possible Improvements</b>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We identified how to attach a J-Link debugger to our Arduino Nano 33 board and figured out at what
                    offset we might have flashed it. Resources collected in the <a
                        href="https://github.com/utsavm9/wasm-for-arduino-mbed/tree/main/builds">builds folder</a> of
                    our repo. If we could solder well, WAMR binary could be run on Arduino Nano 33 board.
                </li>
                <li>Our implementation currently does not make available the Arduino libraries. While there have been
                    many CMake build systems for Arduino, many of them have been abandoned. If a CMake build system of
                    Arduino is available with the support for recent lauched <a
                        href="https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed">ArduinoCore-mbed</a>, then that build system
                    can be integrated into Mbed-CMake to have Arduino libraries also available to the native program.
                </li>
                <li>WAMR AoT compiler would be faster than the currently ported WAMR Interpretor, and is therefore of
                    much interest. By implementing <kbd>mmap</kbd> and related functions in the platform API layer, AoT
                    would be available on WAMR for Mbed.</li>
                <li>By implementing the platform API extension on WAMR, support for multi-threaded WASM
                    applications along with application framework and remote application management would be available
                    in
                    WAMR for Mbed.</li>
