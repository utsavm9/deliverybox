# Smart Delivery Box

## Proposal Abstract

We will explore an application of embedded systems in home and delivery package security. 

Potential project implementations which can be explored:

* Using Arduino Nano to control a locking mechanism, which ensures only authorized people like the house owner and delivery personnel can unlock the box. This locking mechanism is part of a larger structurally-secure delivery box.

* Cost-effective implementation where an Arduino Nano system is attached to an existing mailbox or front door, and it notifies the user though an Android app when packages are delivered. Additionally, with a camera sensor, this system can capture photographs and alert the user when packages are being taken away by unknown people. The Nano system can employ NFC with the home owner's phone to identify when the delivery is being taken away by user themselves or by an unrecognized person.

Deliverables include a embedded system with Arduino Nano and an Android app or a website accessible only on the home's WiFi.
